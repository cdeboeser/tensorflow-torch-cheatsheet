# Tensorflow Torch Cheat Sheet

This repository contains side-by-side comparisons of equal operations in Tensorflow 2.x and Pytorch 1.3+. It is meant to facilitate the transition from in both directions and serve as a quick reference how to do similar things on both frameworks.

So far, I only created a very first notebook on the most basic tensor operations and I will extend 

## Table of Contents

| Notebook | Description |
|:--|:--|
| [Basic Tensor Operations](BasicTensorOperations.ipynb) | Comparing the most fundamental tensor operations like reshaping, splitting, adding, or multiplying matrices |

## Contributing

I am happy about any contributions to extend this cheat sheet. Some todos are:
- Neural network layers
- Custom neural network modules
- Training loops
- Data loading (for various data types)
